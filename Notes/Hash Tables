*Hash Tables is good at implementing a dynamic set that support only dictionary operations INSERT,
SEARCH and DELETE.

*Although the running time of searching in a hash table can be like that of a linked list -
Big-Theta(n), but in practice hash tables performs very well. Under reasonable assumptions the
average time of searching in a hash table is O(1).
