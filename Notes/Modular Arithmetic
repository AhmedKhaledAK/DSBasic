## Modular Arithmetic (from "Introduction to Algorithms")

* Modular arithmetic model (described within the framework of the group theory):
--- Finite Groups: A group (S, ⊕) is a set S together with a binary operation ⊕ defined on S for which the
following properties hold:
    1) Closure: For all a, b ∈ S, we have a ⊕ b ∈ S.
    2) Identity: There exists an element e ∈ S called the identity of the group such that
       e ⊕ a = a ⊕ e = a for all a ∈ S.
    3) Associativity: For all a, b, c ∈ S, we have (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c).
    4) Inverses: For each a ∈ S, there exists a unique element b ∈ S, called the inverse of a, such that
       a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a = e

* If (S, ⊕) is a finite group and (S`, ⊕) is a subgroup of (S, ⊕), then |S`| is a divisor of |S|.
