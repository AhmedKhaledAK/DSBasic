*B-trees are "balanced" search trees designed to work well on disks and other direct-access
secondary storage devices.

*B-trees differ from red-black trees in that B-trees nodes may have many children, from a few to
thousands. That is, the branching factor of B-trees can be quite large. B-trees are similar to
red-black trees in that every n-node B-tree has height O(lgn).
